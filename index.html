    <h3>SUMMARY</h3>
    <hr style = "margin: -15px 0;"/>
    <p>My name is Vishal Sharma and I am a recent graduate from University of New England 
        with a Bachelors in Data Science and a minor in Business Administration. I grew up 
        in a small town called Saco. I have always had a passion for technology and problem solving, which is 
        what led me to pursue a Masters in Data Analytics at Boston University while also 
        learning web development on the side. In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, 
        watching movies, and spending time with my friends and family.</p>
